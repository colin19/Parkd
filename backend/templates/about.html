        <h1>About our site</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>We chose to focus on cities that are notoriously food-truck friendly and walkable. We envision a typical user experience to begin with one of two points of entry, either by scrolling through our parks or scrolling through our food trucks. Then, because of the proximity most trucks have to parks in major cities, consumers are likely to visit a food truck, and then enjoy their food at a park. It is in this assumption that we find our niche. Our users will be able to plan their days out before they leave for lunch or even adjust their plans on the fly as they get hungry. Another advantage our website has is the incorporation of pictures as a third model. In today's society, one of the best ways to get someone's attention is to mention or incorporate social media into a product. Our trucks and parks will be what brings a user to our site, but it is the aesthetic of the site- the google maps, the images scraped from instagram, and the connection between our models will turn new users into repeat users. Our website provides a service that fills a void in the consumer experience in the era of the food truck.</p>

        <h1>Data Source and Interesting Result of Integrating Disparate data</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Some data sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zomato: https://developers.zomato.com/api</li>
            <li>Streetfood: http://data.streetfoodapp.com/1.1/schedule/seattle</li>
            <li>Google Places: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=parks+in+Austin&key=YOUR_API_KEY</li>
            <li>Google Maps Distance API: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&origins=30.2670,-97.7729&destinations=30.2650472,-97.7315725&key=</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Our site incorporated data from multiple API. Sometimes in order to fulfill the data requirements for a single truck or park, we'd have to combine data from multiple API's like Google Places, Zomato, Yelp Fusion, and Streetfood. We also used Google Places API to generate a .JSON file of all of the parks in a city, and then we parsed through the list in order to isolate the data we needed. One such data, was the latitude and longitude coordinates which we would compare with those of the food trucks in order to find parks and trucks that are close to each other. This distance calculation was done via the Google Maps Distance API. Finally, we scraped Instagrams RESTful API for the pictures displayed on the pictures tab of our site.</p>

        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Postman</li>
            <li>GitHub and Slack</li>
            <li>Webstorm</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Multiple tools were incorporated into the development of our site. On the backend, we used tools like Postman and python code in order to scrape and organize our data. For this phase of the project, we organized the data into .csv files that the front end team could enter into the website statically. Other tools that were key to our project were GitHub and slack, we used both to maximize our collaboration as a team.
